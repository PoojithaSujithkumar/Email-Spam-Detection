# 📧 Email Spam Detection – Machine Learning Project  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is part of my **Data Science Internship at Oasis Infobyte**, where I built a **spam detection model** to classify emails as **spam or not spam** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** techniques. The goal was to enhance email filtering by analyzing text patterns.  

## 📊 Dataset  
- Contains a collection of emails labeled as **spam** or **ham (not spam)**  
- Text-based features extracted from email content  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries Used:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Matplotlib  

## 🔍 Workflow  
✅ **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and tokenized text data for better feature extraction.  
✅ **Feature Engineering:** Applied **TF-IDF vectorization** to convert text into numerical form.  
✅ **Model Training:** Trained a **Naive Bayes classifier** for spam detection.  
✅ **Evaluation:** Assessed model performance using **accuracy, confusion matrix, and precision-recall metrics**.  
✅ **Prediction:** Implemented a function to classify new emails in real time.  

## 📈 Results  
- Achieved **high accuracy** in detecting spam emails.  
- Improved email security by filtering out spam efficiently.  

## 🚀 Key Learnings  
- Gained experience in **text preprocessing and NLP techniques**.  
- Strengthened knowledge of **classification algorithms and model evaluation**.
