# Email-Spam-Detection
This project focuses on building an email spam classifier using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning. The model processes email text, extracts meaningful features, and classifies messages as spam or not spam with high accuracy. This project strengthened my skills in NLP, feature engineering, and classification models.
